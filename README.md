# Human Activity Recognition Data Analysis
This repository contains an R script 'run_analysis.R' that performs an analysis on the Human Activity Recognition dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. It consists of accelerometer and gyroscope measurements collected from smartphones while subjects performed various activities. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, along with activity labels and feature vectors.

# Getting Started

After downloading, unzipping, and placing the data in the directory of this repository,...

# Run the script run_analysis.R to automatically unzip the dataset and extract the necessary files.
Execute the analysis:

Run the script run_analysis.R to perform the following steps:
1 Merge the training and test sets into one dataset.
2 Extract the measurements on mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3 Use descriptive activity names to label the activities in the dataset.
4 Label the dataset variables with descriptive names.
5 Create a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6 Save the tidy dataset as MyTidyDataSet.txt in the current directory.

# Results
After running the analysis, a second tidy dataset secTidySet.txt will be generated. This dataset contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
